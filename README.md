# Image-Steganography-using-Python-Tkinter

To run this file just download the "imgstg.py" file and save it on your system and using VS Code or any other code editor run this python file.

**Abstract :**

While sending and receiving personal information securely we must pay attention to the expanding internet usage. There are numerous methods for doing this that can transform the data into various forms, allowing the resultant data to be comprehended if the original form can be restored. The term "encryption" refers to this method. The fact that the existence of the data is not concealed, however, is a significant drawback of this strategy. The unreadable encrypted data may be transformed back into its original form if someone allows enough time. The project focuses on being familiar with the various kinds of steganography that are available. For images, image steganography is used, and the relevant data is also decrypted to get the message image. Since this can be done in several ways, image steganography is studied and one of the methods is used to demonstrate it. Image steganography refers to hiding information i.e. text, images or audio files in another image or video files. This hidden information can be retrieved only through proper decoding technique.

**Problem Statement :**

In today’s world, the communication is the basic necessity in every growing area. Everyone wants the secrecy and safety of their communicating data. In our daily life, we use many secure pathways like internet or telephone for transferring and sharing information, but it’s not safe at a certain level. So to make the data securely transfer without letting the third party know we can use the Steganography technique.

**Solution :**

This project helps to understand the Image Steganography to anyone who wants to learn the how the encryption and decryption works and how the secret message can be hidden inside the image. This project well demonstrates image steganography with the help of python Tkinter module. I hope this finds you well.

Happy Coding! :)
